        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We analyse the effects of the ban of ChatGPT, a generative pre-trained
transformer chatbot, on individual productivity. We first compile data on the
hourly coding output of over 8,000 professional GitHub users in Italy and other
European countries to analyse the impact of the ban on individual productivity.
Combining the high-frequency data with the sudden announcement of the ban in a
difference-in-differences framework, we find that the output of Italian
developers decreased by around 50% in the first two business days after the ban
and recovered after that. Applying a synthetic control approach to daily Google
search and Tor usage data shows that the ban led to a significant increase in
the use of censorship bypassing tools. Our findings show that users swiftly
implement strategies to bypass Internet restrictions but this adaptation
activity creates short-term disruptions and hampers productivity.]]></summary>
