          "description": "時間が経つと忘れる気がするので記録に残すことにした。\n注：会社のことについては基本的にニュースになっている（公になっている）情報をもとに書く\n1月下旬 2022年から Big Tech をはじめ多くの会社でレイオフが実行されている。\n Amazonが1万7000人以上を解雇へ、近年のテクノロジー企業で最多 Microsoft、従業員1万人の大量レイオフ Googleも過去最大の1万2000人の大量レイオフへ ｢現実世界｣の問題を解決したいマーク・ザッカーバーグ。Meta、1万1000人のレイオフ  勤務先でもレイオフ発表＆USで実行されたけど、雇用に関する法律は国ごとに違うので日本を含む各国でのレイオフについては今後現地法に基づいて実行されるという話。\nつまり近々レイオフされるかもしれないけど宙ぶらりんらしい。宙ぶらりんの状態のことを “in limbo” と言うらしい。“My employment status is in limbo” と言う。\nこんな時でも、知らない単語を学ぶ機会になるようだ。\n発表があった次の勤務日は、みんな仕事する気にはならない感じだった。普段は在宅勤務と出社を組み合わせたハイブリッドワークになっている会社だが、出社していた人がいつもより多かったように思った。みんな不安だし、誰かと話したかったんだと思う。\n2月 自分の周りには大きな変化はなかった。だけど通知があった国もあったらしい。\nここで見えてきたのは各国の雇用制度の違い。US は “at-will employment” という「雇用者・被用者のどちらからでも・いつでも・いかなる理由でも・理由がなくても自由に解約できるという原則」(from wikipedia)制度になっているから人を解雇するのは簡単らしい。\n一方でヨーロッパの国で人を解雇するのは大変らしい。特にフランスとかドイツは厳しいらしい。日本って解雇しにくいって話があるけど他の国と比べるとそんなに規制が強いわけではないらしい。別に知らなくてよかったことだけどこういうことを知るのは面白い。\nLinkedin の投稿を見るとどうやらレイオフの通知は深夜から朝方にかけてあるらしいという話から夜寝る時に不安になってなかなか寝付けなかったり、深夜にふと目が覚めてスマホをチェックしたり、朝起きてすぐスマホをチェックしたりするようになっていた。もうすでに精神的な疲労が大きい。\n3月 これずっと続くのきついなと思った次の日、朝起きたら同僚からLINEが来てて「対象者には通知されたみたいですよ」とのこと。自分の会社用のスマホのメールボックスに「Your role has been indentified as impacted(あなたはレイオフの対象です)」を告げるメールが。\n あー当たったかーーーーー\n これが第一声。「今やりかけのプロジェクト途中だけどここで終わりかー」と言うのが頭に浮かんだ。ある程度進んでるものであと少しでリリースできそうなものとか、これから考えていこうとしてたものとか。そういうのが全部もう終わりです、と。\n感情的にはゲームをやっている途中で親に電源を切られた時と似ていた。「まだ途中なのに」「せめてキリのいいところまでやらせて」という気持ちだった。もちろん「なんで僕なんですか」という気持ちがなかったわけじゃないけど、 じゃあ誰だったらいいのって言われるとそれに対する答えなんてなくて。去ることになる人はそうだけど、残ることになる人もなんとも言えない気持ちになったと思う。残る側の人のこの気持ちを Survivor’s guilt というらしい。\n ここまでレイオフという言葉を使っていたけど正確には退職勧奨という「会社側から従業員への働きかけ」というもので、断る権利はあるらしい。\n グーグル社員に突然届く“退職パッケージ”。労働組合｢違法な解雇は許さない｣  断る権利はあるけどたくさんの人と話をして、色々考えた結果サインする（辞める）ことにした。\n通知から２週間後、退職の合意書にサインして同僚にさよならを言ってオフィスを出た。\n国によってはいきなり通知されてもうオフィスに入れませんってこともあったらしいので、さよならの挨拶ができるだけよかったかなと思った。\nちなみに日本の会社だと退職する時ってお菓子を持ってお世話になった人にお礼を伝えてお菓子を配るってことをやると思うんだけど、日本特有の風習のようで お菓子を持って挨拶しに行ったら「Oh omiyage?」とお土産と勘違いされることが何度かあった。\nというわけで入社してから3年で退職することに。\n3月中旬 - 転職活動開始 仕事はなくなったけどすぐに解雇になるわけではなくて、少し雇用は継続する（Garden leave というらしい）のでその間に次の職を見つけることに。",
