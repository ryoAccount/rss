We first compile data on the\nhourly coding output of over 8,000 professional GitHub users in Italy and other\nEuropean countries to analyse the impact of the ban on individual productivity.\nCombining the high-frequency data with the sudden announcement of the ban in a\ndifference-in-differences framework, we find that the output of Italian\ndevelopers decreased by around 50% in the first two business days after the ban\nand recovered after that. Applying a synthetic control approach to daily Google\nsearch and Tor usage data shows that the ban led to a significant increase in\nthe use of censorship bypassing tools. Our findings show that users swiftly\nimplement strategies to bypass Internet restrictions but this adaptation\nactivity creates short-term disruptions and hampers productivity.",
